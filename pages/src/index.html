          This website is an attempt to go back to the origins of the web, to
          it's simplest form, old web aesthetics and no frameworks or libraries
          whatsoever. A sort of artisan development.
        </p>

        I built my first website back in 2002 through the only user-friendly
        option available back then -
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities" target="_blank"
          >GeoCities</a
        >. I still have the URL:
        <a
          href="http://www.geocities.com/uribarialex/1.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >http://www.geocities.com/uribarialex/1.html</a
        >
        but unfortunately, the site were not preserved and I were unable to find
        it archived elsewhere. Since then, I tried many different things to host
        my site: free hostings with site builders, Wordpress, static website
        generators like
        <a href="https://getpublii.com/" target="_blank">Publii</a>, more
        complex static website generators with CLI and returning back to
        Wordpress again. I was never fully satisfied with the result (except,
        probably, with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities" target="_blank"
          >GeoCities</a
        >...).

        I think it is time to build something of my own. Static, serverless, but
        built by myself. Without any libraries, using vanilla Javascript. A year
        ago I would consider this unachivable due to my poor developer skills,
        but today, thanks to many tools available for junior developers, I think
        it is possible. I will be using Amazon Q and Amazon CodeWhisperer for
        guidance. Ideally this site will have a backend for article publishing
        and maybe some comments feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the project will be worth it, I'll make the code public on my Github
        so you could build it on your own as well. In line with the the early
        internet philosophy, the idea is to build this site as frugal as
        possible (free, to be precise). Thefore, the services will be chosen
        with this idea in mind, free and no credit card requirment.
