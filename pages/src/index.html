    <h1>Alex's Uribarri personal website</h1>
    <p>
      I built my first website using basic html back in 2002 through
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities" target="_blank"
        >GeoCities</a
      >
      hosting provider. Since then, I tried many things: free hostings with site
      builders, Wordpress, static website generators with GUI like Publii,
      static website generators with CLI and Wordpress again. I was never fully
      satisfied with the result (except, probably, with
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities" target="_blank"
        >GeoCities</a
      >...).
    </p>

      I think it is time to build something of my own. Static, serverless, but
      built by myself. Without any libraries, using vanilla Javascript. A year
      ago I would consider this unachivable, but today, thanks to many tools
      available for free for junior developers as I mean I think it is possible.
      I will be using Amazon Q and Amazon CodeWhisperer for guidance and ideally
      the web will have backend for article publishing in an authomatic fashion
      (serverless function that will post new html document to a hosting)
    </p>
    <p>
      If the project will worth it, I'll make the code public on my Github repo
      so you could build it on your own as well.
    </p>

      With kindest regards, <br />
