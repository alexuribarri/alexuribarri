        This website is an attempt to go back to the origins of the web, to it's
        simplest form, but now using modern technologies like serverless.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built my first website back in 2002 through the only user-friendly
        option available back then -
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities" target="_blank"
          >GeoCities</a
        >. Since then, I tried many different things to host my site: free
        hostings with site builders, Wordpress, static website generators like
        <a href="https://getpublii.com/" target="_blank">Publii</a>, more
        complex static website generators with CLI and returning back to
        Wordpress again. I was never fully satisfied with the result (except,
        probably, with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities" target="_blank"
          >GeoCities</a
        >...).
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it is time to build something of my own. Static, serverless, but
        built by myself. Without any libraries, using vanilla Javascript. A year
        ago I would consider this unachivable, but today, thanks to many tools
        available for junior developers as I am, I think it is possible. I will
        be using Amazon Q and Amazon CodeWhisperer for guidance. Ideally this
        site will have a backend for article publishing and maybe some comments
        feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the project will be worth it, I'll make the code public on my Github
        repo so you could build it on your own as well.
