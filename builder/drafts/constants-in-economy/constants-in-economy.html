        Economics right now is like physics in the post Newton era. When Newton
        published his famous theory of classical mechanics it was a revolution,
        similar to Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the model proposed by Newton had some limitations. It was only
        applicable to big objects and was lacking some fundaments to unite both
        quantum and classical worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
        200 years had to elapse before Einstein discovered his Theory of
        Relativity that completed the way we understand the nature and led to
        unprecedented discoveries. Basically he introduced something that
        Newton’s model were missing – a constant. When you have a constant, you
        can precisely measure everything at once. It’s a huge leap in science.
        Einstein’s Mass–energy equivalence is maybe the most famous formulae in
        the world:
      </p>
      <q>E = mc2</q>
      <p>
        Where “c” is the speed of light in vacuum, a constant, Holy Grail of
        physics, the Archimedes’ Lever!
      </p>

      <p>
        And that’s precisely what economics is missing right now – a constant
        that would link it all together – scarcity driven world (microeconomics)
        and world of abundance (macro).
      </p>

      <p>
        When I was studying economic growth I couldn’t believe that there’s
        nothing we can use as constant. And during that self-imposed challenge,
        I tried to create a model that helps me to understand better the real
        economic growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started by establishing the parameters that true economic constant
        should have to be valid for inclusion into the system. Basically the
        parameters are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It should be compatible cross country/cross time. By this I understand
          that, for example a value “0.15” in USA in 1830 has the same value and
          meaning in Russia in 1995, no need of conversion
        </li>
        <li>
          It should be independent and without possibility to introduce changes
        </li>
        <li>It should be simple to understand</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since I’m not a professional economist I do have some right to mistake.
        So don’t be too strict judging me. After establishing above parameters I
        started to search for such a characteristics that match above
        parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Money, gold, oil, platinum, antimatter (currently the most expensive
        substance on Earth)… all these elements are subject to changes over time
        or region so they are not valid for my purpose. The problem is that
        everything on Earth is not constant but relative, except… the Earth
        itself. We certainly know that there’s one Earth and we don’t expect to
        find anyhow soon another one nor we think to cut it apart as orange into
        8 parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I tried to imagine a model where monetary system is based in this
        constant. So if we have only one Earth, we have a scarcity that can be
        measured and it will remain constant over time. What if we invent new
        electronic currency (just like Bitcoin), but not expansive, like all
        currencies, but scarce, and the sum of M2 (coins and notes in
        circulation and other money equivalents that are easily convertible into
        cash plus short-term time deposits in banks and 24-hour money market
        funds) will always be 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we believe in endogenous growth model, what we can expect from this?
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Since productivity is growing, we may expect steady appreciation of
          the money (for each unit of money, you can buy more goods)
        </li>
        <li>
          We may expect the same effects due to population growth (a scarce
          resource should be divided among more people – the cost of labor
          declines)
        </li>
        <li>
          Above two statements will lead to problems – prices are flexible but
          salaries are rigid.
        </li>
        <li>
          But may work perfectly in society where all workers are freelancers
        </li>
        <li>
          The economic growth probably will decline – steady appreciation of
          money would trigger higher interest rates.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Clearly, as monetary system such model brings more problems than
        solutions. People usually like to be ignorant and prefer sweet lies
        rather than hard reality. Therefore countries like their ability to
        devaluate currency – you decrease salaries without creating a social
        unrest. Scarcity based currency is good only for mature societies.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what if we look at above model not like a proposal for future
        currency, but like a proposal for a new economic indicator. Just like we
        use “constant dollars of years (lots of different years used)” we could
        use the above fictional currency to express everything in economy. For
        example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How much did we take on credit from our planet (a global M4-M2 (M4 is
          M2 plus long term credits)
        </li>
        <li>
          Difference in salary between UK worker in 1918 and Russian worker in
          2015 in real terms (you can compare directly!)
        </li>
        <li>Real appreciation of money</li>
        <li>
          Real share of each and every person of Earth as a whole (finally, we
          people are shareholders)
        </li>

        <li>Many, many other things!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since through this indicator almost everything can be easily explained,
        economics would be much more open for all the people on earth, situation
        that will trigger more accurate demands to our Governments and would
        increase democracy and public control. But with current mess of formulas
        and indicators, based on different things, this is basically impossible.
