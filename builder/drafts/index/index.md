# Welcome to my personal page

As you can probably see, this website is an attempt to go back to the origins of the web, to it's simplest form, with no frameworks or libraries.

I built my first website back in 2002 through the only user-friendly option available back then - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities" target="_blank">Geocities</a>. I still have the URL: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/uribarialex/1.html" target="blank">http://www.geocities.com/uribarialex/1.html</a> but unfortunately, the site was not preserved and I was unable to find it archived elsewhere. Since then, I tried many different things to host my site: free hostings with site builders, Wordpress, static website generators like Publii, more complex static website generators with CLI and returning back to Wordpress again. I was never fully satisfied with the result (except, probably, with GeoCities...).

So I decided it is time to build something of my own. Why not build a minimalist CRM that covers the basics? Ideally, serving content with a unique HTML file. And my personal webstie will be the testground for such CRM. As soon as the CRM will reach MVP, I'll publish a GitHub repo with the source code so anyone will be able to use it and contribute.

## What's next?

Next most important update will be the image management. I still don't know how to implement this in a reasonably authmated fashon, but this is a priority. An image is better than 100 words!
