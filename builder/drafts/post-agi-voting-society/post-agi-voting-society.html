      As we are approaching the era of artificial general intelligence (aka AGI)
      it would be productive to imagine a world where human labor, as we know
      it, is not needed anymore as everything is done by robots. This scenario
      is not science fiction. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI) allow us
      to make an educated guess that such setting might become reality within 15
      years.

      We should expect a very painful transition period with few winners and
      many losers. Unfortunately, such a situation will likely result in
      violence. At some point, the mess will settle and hopefully humanity will
      find a receipt for a new economy. Economy, in which humans are not
      required for any type of work, creativity or inventions. Ideally, all the
      humans will live as western world retirees.

      As human society requires a certain amount of fair inequality to make life
      interesting, I envision that such society will be built around three types
      of voting: <b>consumption</b>, <b>investment</b>, and
      <b>political vote</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unavoidable part of such society is Universal Basic Income (UBI).
      Monthly payment for everyone is the
      <b>basic pillar of the voting society</b>. The concept of UBI isn’t new.
      As far as in ancient Rome the idea of giving the basics for free was
      widespread and part of normal life. The so-called grain dole and corn dole
      were free allowances of the basic staples for these in need.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>The first pillar</b> of voting society is <b>consumer choice</b>.
      People will vote for the products they like by spending part of their UBI
      in consumption. This way, they will choose the best products AI create and
      produce. Such consumption will refine AI skills. Billions of people will
      fill their needs by buying products – some will choose eco products, some
      will try new flavors, some will prefer packaging over content. All this
      information will be crucial for AI that will design the consumer products
      to improve and adapt to the requirements of the people. Changing
      generations and preferences will rapidly feed design and production
      elements of AI and reduce waste with better consumer alignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The second pillar</b> of voting society is <b>investment</b>. AI may
      generate infinite brilliant ideas. But there will still be constraints in
      terms of energy, resources, and time. Therefore, people will have to
      choose wisely what entrepreneur endeavor to pick. People will use
      disposable part of their monthly UBI to invest in such endeavors. This
      will be one of the few ways to gain additional money through dividends or
      stock growth. Other ways will be artisan work, speculation on antiquities,
      real estate and general buying and selling of rare items.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The third pillar</b> of voting society is <b>political vote</b>: both
      long- and short-term political decisions that will govern both society and
      AI at all levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      These three types of voting will introduce healthy inequality into society
      and will make life interesting and worth living. Necessary safeguards will
      be required to ensure that such inequality is within certain limits and
      does not create a layered society. Additionally, as humans will have
      infinite free time, a
      <b> universal pillar of spiritual and physical personal development </b>
      is essential to avoid decadence, excess, and depravity. But this is a
      whole new and different topic, worth exploring in next blog posts.
