      I’m confronted with a dilemma: how to manage images in my tiny CMS. Choice
      one is to create a single repository of images. All the images would go in
      a single folder and this folder would have a massive database in a form of
      a JSON file with the image properties. Option number two: create a
      separate image folder for each and every blog post or page.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, I implemented the option number two, but I’m not fully
      confident. I don’t like the idea of being in a situation where I would
      have to load two identical files so these files could be used in different
      posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The option one will not have such issues, as full repository of images
      will be available from single location. The problem is the complexity of
      implementing such setup. Files would have to be identified by their
      respective filenames to be able to query the JSON file with picture
      characteristics. This might lead to file corruption, inconsistent results
      if there are files with the same names... In nutshell, a complexity that I
      try to avoid with this tiny CMS.

      To practice a little, I started building the photo
      <a href="../photo.html" class="href">gallery page</a>. I want to build an
      “image showcase” pop up web page, so if someone wants more details on
      certain image, a pop up would be opened with added details and higher
      resolution. This experience will help me decide which way should I take in
      my endeavor.
