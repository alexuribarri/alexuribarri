<p>I will use this post to test the ability to add images to posts:</p>
<div class="post-figure">
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/20180201_072252.jpg" alt="Dnipro, Ukraine" />
    <figcaption>A flight over mouth of a Dnipro river and Black Sea</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<h2>Update December 29th 2023</h2>
<p>
  So far I managed to do the following in regards to images: when writer decides
  to add an image, they should copy it to the folder of the draft article. When
  the upgrade.mjs script is executed, then all the images are minimized using
  imagemin and resized to 800px using jimp and then moved to the root folder of
  the website.
</p>
<code>
  import imagemin from "imagemin";<br />
  import imageminJpegtran from "imagemin-jpegtran";<br />
  import imageminPngquant from "imagemin-pngquant";
</code>

<p>
  Next steps would probably require the creation of an image database, where all
  the images have their characteristics stores, like location, descritpions,
  etc.. Will keep you posted
</p>
<h2>New problems...</h2>
<p>
  OK, after uploading the files to web hosting, the Lighouse results are
  terrible due to CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
</p>
<div class="post-figure">
  <figure>
    <img src="/img/cls-problem.png" alt="CLS Problem" height="300px" />
    <figcaption>

<h2>Update 14th January 2024</h2>
<p>
  Added the ability to add watermatk to images following this

    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"

</p>
<p>
  <code>
    const image = await Jimp.read(`../pages/dist/${file}`); <br />
    const logo = await Jimp.read("./static/logo.png");<br />

    await image.resize(800, Jimp.AUTO); // resize to max 800px <br />
    await logo.resize(80, Jimp.AUTO); // resize to max 800px <br />

    const X = 10; <br />
    const Y = 10; <br />
    image.composite(logo, X, Y, [ { mode: Jimp.BLEND_SCREEN, opacitySource: 0.1,
    opacityDest: 1, }, ]); <br />
    await image.write(`../pages/dist/${file}`);
  </code>
</p>
<p>
  As you can see from the images in this page, watermarks are alreade
  incorporated to the images.

<h3>Updated folder structure</h3>
I also updated folder structure, creating separate image folder and file folder
for each and every post or article. I still need to resolve some issues with
path as I see some "/./" in the middle that shouldn't be there (surprisingly,
everything works anyways)

<div class="post-figure">
  <figure>
    <img
      src="/img/problem-with-path.png"
      alt="pronlem with path"
      height="50px"
    />
    <figcaption>
      I need to review the above "/./" additional path part...
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
