        Trying to build my very own simple CMS with no frameworks nor libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built my first website back in 2002 through the only user-friendly
        option available back then -
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities" target="_blank"
          >Geocities</a
        >. I still have the URL:
        <a href="http://www.geocities.com/uribarialex/1.html" target="blank"
          >http://www.geocities.com/uribarialex/1.html</a
        >
        but unfortunately, the site was not preserved and I was unable to find
        it archived elsewhere. Since then, I tried many different things to host
        my site: free hostings with site builders, Wordpress, static website
        generators like Publii, more complex static website generators with CLI
        and returning back to Wordpress again. I was never fully satisfied with
        the result (except, probably, with GeoCities...).
      </p>
      <p>
        So I decided it is time to build something of my own. Why not build a
        minimalist CMS that covers the basics? Ideally, serving content with a
        unique HTML file. And my personal webstie will be the testground for
        such CMS. As soon as the CMS will reach MVP, I&#39;ll publish a GitHub
        repo with the source code so anyone will be able to use it and
        contribute.

      <h2>Updates</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>December 4th, 2023 - Started the project</li>
        <li>
          December 4th, 2023 - Started working on automatic page generator
        </li>
        <li>
          December 6th, 2023 - Created the compiler to read markdown files in
          certain folder and translate these into html. Markdown files include
          &quot;matter&quot; part with metda details of the post
        </li>
        <li>
          December 27th, 2023 - Updated the homepage with the content generated
          by the node.js app
        </li>
        <li>
          January 7th, 2024 - Decided change the post editing file from MarkDown
          to html. MarkDown is very limited compared to html. Also, updated CSS
          of the site. Again, no frameworks, no libraries. Everything manually
          crafted.
        </li>
        <li>
          18th February 2024 - Updated navigation management: now blog entries
          will be located in the blog folder. This required an updated to
          navigation function to ensure the links are escalating to higher
          directories from files in child directories.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What&#39;s next?</h2>
      <p>
        Next I will work on category and meta description of the posts. Also
        will start working on the management of the categorization. <br />
        [Partially done] Next most important update will be the image
        management. I still don&#39;t know how to implement this in a reasonably
        automated fashion, but this is a priority. An image is better than 100
        words!
