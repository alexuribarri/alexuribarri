      Personal webpage is the space for your thoughts in the www. Billions of
      people with internet access can know about you in a unique way through
      this space. The only restrictions are your creativity, local laws, and
      common ethics. You set the T&amp;C, the design and viewer experience. You
      build the content. While social platforms may offer simple way to publish
      your thoughts, the way thoughts are presented and served to people is out
      of your control.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many available CMSs that give you more control over the
      presentation of your thouhgts compared to social platforms. The most
      common is WordPress, which is free to use if self-hosted. It provides a
      myriad of configuration options, plugins, themes and many more. I used
      WordPress for years to host this site. In fact, I will be migrating my old
      posts from WordPress install, so the structure of old posts will keep the
      standard WordPress layout. The problem with such CMSs is that they are
      still incorporating plenty of libraries, frameworks and other code that
      make pages heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to build a site that will work with essentials – in best case
      scenario loading a single HTML file with all the elements in it. No
      separate CSS, JS… everything inside the HTML. The reality is that I don’t
      really need all these frameworks downloaded from external CDNs, external
      fonts, CSS styles that are never used. We are overprovisioning on all that
      code that we might never use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason to build my own minimalist CMS is to make this project my
      hobby. I love node.js and there’s no better way to learn it than building
      something with it. When this CMS will reach the MVP stage, I’ll open
      source it and will publish the GitHub repository so everyone can
      contribute.
    </p>
    <p>With this being said, Happy New 2024!</p>
